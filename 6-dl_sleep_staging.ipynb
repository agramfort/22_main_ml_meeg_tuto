    "# Sleep staging on the Sleep Physionet dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to train a convolutional neural network on raw EEG data to classify sleep stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/sample-datasets/plot_sleep.html) and [braindecode](https://braindecode.org/auto_examples/plot_sleep_staging.html) sleep staging examples, the [`mne-torch`](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-torch) repository, as well as\n",

    "## Sleep staging\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep staging is the process of identifying the sleep stage someone is in by analyzing their EEG and other physiological signals. Sleep recordings are traditionally divided into 30-s windows, and one of five categories (\"stages\") is attributed to each window:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. W: wakefulness\n",
    "2. N1: light sleep\n",
    "3. N2: deeper sleep\n",
    "4. N3: deep sleep\n",
    "5. R: rapid eye movement\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep staging usually relies on capturing changes in the spectral properties of the EEG as well as transient events (e.g., sleep spindles, k-complexes, slow waves, etc.) that occur under the different sleep stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to perform sleep staging on unseen raw EEG. We will use the [Sleep Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/) dataset, which contains 153 overnight sleep recordings from 78 individuals. These recordings were manually staged by sleep experts, providing us with the required classification targets to train and evaluate our ConvNet on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of the tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant to be a general hands-on introduction to training neural networks on EEG data. With this in mind, the default training hyperparameters below are set such that computations don't take too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have been through the whole material though, you are encouraged to experiment with the different elements of the pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing, neural network architecture, optimization parameters, etc.) to try to improve performance as much as possible.\n",
